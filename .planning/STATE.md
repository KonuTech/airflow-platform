# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-11)

**Core value:** Every file, batch and record that enters the platform can be traced, explained, reprocessed and trusted.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — repository-toolchain-ci-skeleton

## Current Position

Phase: 2 — kind Cluster & Core Infrastructure
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-08-11 — Phase 01 complete, transitioned to Phase 2

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Phase structure follows research SUMMARY.md stages S0–S14, not README §92. Five deviations preserved — idempotency inside the vertical slice (D1), metadata control plane designed up front (D2), Vault after the slice behind `SecretsResolver` (D3), CI skeleton first (D4), observability as an explicit stage (D5).
- Roadmap: Phases 2 and 3 are fully parallel (~25% of effort) — infrastructure track vs. pure-Python library track, no shared files.
- Roadmap: Phase 4 is the strictly serial critical path. It closes only when a re-run produces zero additional rows.
- Repository moved to WSL ext4 (`/home/user/projects/airflow-platform`) — measured 50–60× penalty on `/mnt/c` 9p small-file operations.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **kind and helm are not installed** on this machine — Phase 2 prerequisite.
- Phase 2 must decide kubelet reservations, `maxPods` and `extraMounts` at cluster-creation time; changing them later requires destroying the cluster (PITFALLS #10, #11).
- `values-ci.yaml` must be written in Phase 2 even though Phase 11's ephemeral-kind E2E consumes it — retrofitting profile parameterization is expensive.
- Helm 4.2.3 against Helm-3 charts is the MEDIUM-confidence call in STACK.md; `3.21.3` is the documented fallback.
- Three spikes carry pre-declared pass criteria: U1 and U3 in Phase 4, U2 in Phase 5.
